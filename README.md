# Passkeyper
This is an open-source Android app designed for secure storage of your passwords. It is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.passkeyper.android) for free with zero ads.

## Future Plans
This is, ideally, only the beginning. In the future I would like to develop a server-side portion to this project so that users can securely store their passwords on a machine in their own homes, rather than in the cloud.
